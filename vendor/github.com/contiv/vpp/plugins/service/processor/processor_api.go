// ServiceProcessorAPI defines the API of the Service Processor.
//
// The processor receives RESYNC and data-change events for endpoints and services
// from the service plugin. The state of the K8s configuration is internally
// cached (since the last RESYNC). The cache is used to match subsets of endpoints
// with the corresponding service definition (including ports).
// Based on the service type, the list of addresses on which the service should
// be exposed is determined.
//
// Processor also maintains the set of interfaces connecting frontends (physical
// interfaces and pods that do not run any service) and backends (pods which act
// as endpoints of at least one service). The set of physical interfaces and
// interfaces connecting pods are learned from the Contiv plugin.
//
// The combined service and endpoint state/configuration data are passed
// further to all registered renderers. The processor allows to register multiple
// renderers at once, each receiving the same set of data.
