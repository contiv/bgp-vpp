// VppNode represents a node in the k8s cluster with container networking
// based on VPP vswitch.
// The key attribute is the integer attribute <id>, a cluster-wide unique
// identifier starting from 1 and re-using free entries, used primarily to dissect
// cluster IP ranges to obtain subnets suitable for address allocation
// for endpoints inside the given node.
// <name> is the node identifier as used by Kubernetes.
// <ip_addresses> is a list of IP addresses assigned to the node in the VPP network
// stack. As opposed to node management IP addresses, which are assigned to host
// interfaces, these IP addresses are not known to Kubernetes. For compatibility
// with older Contiv versions, <ip_address> should be appended to <ip_addresses>
// to get all the VPP node IP addresses.
